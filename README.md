#  Plants Stories

Before there were humans, there were plants. Throughout history, plants have nourished and inspired us in many different ways. Whether it's a tasty recipe, carefully-guarded healing cure, or creative projects in music and the arts, the impact of plants on the course of human cultures is astounding. Indeed, we humans have quite extensive and diverse relationships with plants. Despite laying down sturdy roots, plants are very active and influential. Their unique compositions of chemicals, colours, and dispersion have both helped and harmed us humans across time. They feed us, shelter us, help us dream, soothe our stresses, and more often than we'd like to admit -- kill us dead.

In efforts to capture, uplift, and showcase these dynamic inter-species relationships, the research institution Dumbarton Oaks coined the term "Plant Humanities" which  "explores and communicates the unparalleled significance of plants to human culture."[^1] Since its inception, interest and application of Plant Humanities, as an approach, initiative, and discipline, has grown considerably. This enthusiasm for plants has sprouted several fruitful collabrations across disciplines and sectors around the world.

Through Plant Humanities, we are able to better understand the overlapping connections human beings have with the nature which surrounds us. These exchanges enhance our affinity for protecting, preserving, and bolstering both biodiversity and biocultural diversity, which are increasingly threatened by the ongoing impacts of climate change.

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]

## Map

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.

# Plants of Cambodia

The Kingdom of ==Cambodia=={Q424} is considered a "biodiversity hotspot" in mainland ==Southeast Asia=={Q11708}.[^2]
Plants are very important in many parts of Cambodian day life and culture. They are eaten as food, made into medicines, used as decoration, and are incorporated into specific rituals for many ==rites of passage=={Q1131696} and community events. We began Plant Planet Plate as a way to share, safeguard, and celebrate the bio(cultural)diversity of Cambodia with Cambodian nationals, members of the diaspora, and interested plant enthusiasts all over the world! This work is an open-access, academically rigorous, resource that we hope you share within others.



# Our Mission

+ To understand how people living in ==Oddar Meanchey Province, Cambodia== {Q629538} collect, prepare, and use foraged plants in their daily lives as food, medicine, and beyond.
+ To highlight local plant species and cultural practices around them 
+ To highlight glimpses of the local traditional ecological knowledge of the vibrant communities living around the province



# Design & approaches

Our project uses a mix of theories and methods from the disciplines of ==ethnobotany=={Q841408}, ==food studies=={Q3232953}, and ==medical anthropology=={Q1779521}. In order to capture individual thoughts, experiences, and perceptions of people with the plants around them we conducted semi-structured interviews. We asked people to explain to us their foraging habits, the different plant species they encounter, and how they use them. When possible, we accompanied these people to collect ==botanical specimens== {Q120431565} of the plants they were describing. We visited the protected Monk Community Forest, where we spoke to and were guided by several monks living there to better understand plants which abundantly grew around them. We hosted a "forage and feast" field trip with several local students from the ==Enfants du Mékong== {Q29378729} school, where

At a glance: 
+ Conducted 50 semi-structured interviews with people living across Oddar Meanchey Province in Khmer with live English field translation
+ Created a Plant Planet Plate Garden 
+ Hosted 1 "Forage and Feast" field trip with Enfants du Mékong
+ Built 2 plant presses from local materials for the Agri-Tech Centre
+ 
+ Prepared
