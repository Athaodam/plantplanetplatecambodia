#  Plants Stories

Before there were humans, there were plants. Throughout history, plants have nourished and inspired us in many different ways. Whether it's ancient food recipes, carefully guarded medical cures, or creative projects in music and the arts, the impact of plants are astoundingly present. Unsurprisingly, scholars and plant enthusiasts can agree that humans have extensive relationships with plants... and these relationships are not in one direction. 

Despite laying down sturdy roots, plants are very active and influential. Their unique compositions of chemicals, colours, and dispersion have both helped and harmed us humans across time. In efforts to capture, uplift, and showcase these dynamic inter-species relationships, the research institution ==Dumbarton Oaks=={Q1264942} coined the term =="Plant Humanities"=={Q104796447} which  "explores and communicates the unparalleled significance of plants to human culture."[^1] Since its inception in 2018, interest and application of Plant Humanities, as an approach, initiative, and discipline, has grown considerably. This enthusiasm for plants has sprouted several fruitful collabrations across disciplines and sectors around the world.

Through Plant Humanities, we are able to better understand the overlapping connections human beings have with the nature which surrounds us. These exchanges enhance our affinity for protecting, preserving, and bolstering both ==biodiversity=={Q47041} and ==biocultural diversity=={Q4914734}, which are increasingly threatened by the ongoing impacts of ==climate change=={Q7942}.


# Plants of Cambodia

The Kingdom of ==Cambodia=={Q424} is considered a "biodiversity hotspot" in mainland ==Southeast Asia=={Q11708}.[^2]
Plants are very important in many parts of Cambodian day life and culture. They are eaten as food, made into medicines, used as decoration, and are incorporated into specific rituals for many ==rites of passage=={Q1131696} and community events. We began Plant Planet Plate as a way to share, safeguard, and celebrate the bio(cultural)diversity of Cambodia with Cambodian nationals, members of the diaspora, and interested plant enthusiasts all over the world! This work is an open-access, academically rigorous, resource that we hope you share within others.



# Our Mission

+ To understand how people living in Oddar Meanchey Province, Cambodia collection, prepare, and use foraged plants in their daily lives as food, medicine, and beyond.
+ To highlight local plant species and cultural practices around them 
+ To highlight glimpses of the local traditional ecological knowledge of the vibrant communities living around the province



# Design & approaches

Our project uses a mix of theories and methods from the disciplines of ==ethnobotany=={Q841408}, ==food studies=={Q3232953}, and ==medical anthropology=={Q1779521}. In order to capture individual thoughts, experiences, and perceptions of people with the plants around them we conducted semi-structured interviews. We asked people to explain to us their foraging habits, the different plant species they encounter, and how they use them. When possible, we accompanied these people to collect ==botanical specimens== {Q120431565} of the plants they were describing. We visited the protected Monk Community Forest, where we spoke to and were guided by several monks living there to better understand plants which abundantly grew around them. What we unearthed were

# Our Community 

Plant Planet Plate is composed of the stories and insights of people living across Oddar Meanchey province. We are grateful for all the knowledge, stories, and plant-centered moments that they shared with us. This would not be possible without their support and guidance! អរគុណច្រើន
