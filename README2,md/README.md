# Introduction

You might think of a ==Game of Thrones=={Q23572} character when you think of the name Tansy, but really it is a beautiful, yet tricky, plant common in ==Limburg, The Netherlands=={Q1093}. It is known for its bright yellow round flower heads which can withstand fierce weather circumstances. That is probably why the plant got its name: Tanacetum Vulgare.
